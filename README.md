# Export iOS Assets for Photoshop

A Photoshop script for exporting assets for iOS projects at @1x, @2x and @3x.

The script works by duplicating current document, then scaling it to each of the 3 common iOS sizes (@1x, @2x, and @3x) and then placing the files inside a folder next to the PSD.

The script works almost the same as the original one (https://github.com/UncorkedStudios/export-to-ios) but instead of one layer the whole document is exported.

## Installation
1. Download the script here

2. Move the .jsx file to your Photoshop scripts folder. If you don't know where that is, you can easily find out by following the instructions <a href="http://www.outbackphoto.net/news/2013/2/17/free-script-where-is-my-photoshop-scripts-folder.html" target="_blank">on this quick post</a>.
