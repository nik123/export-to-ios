# Export iOS Assets for Photoshop

A Photoshop script for exporting assets for iOS projects at @1x, @2x and @3x.

The script works by duplicating current document, then scaling it to each of the 3 common iOS sizes (@1x, @2x, and @3x) and then placing the files inside a folder next to the PSD.

The script works almost the same as the original one (https://github.com/UncorkedStudios/export-to-ios) but instead of one layer the whole document is exported.

## Installation
1. Download the script here

2. Move the .jsx file to your Photoshop scripts folder. On MacOS scripts folder should be located at "/Applications/Adobe Photoshop CS6/Presets/Scripts"
